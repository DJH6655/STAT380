## Install Packages:

```{r}
library(RKaggle)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```


Read in Data

```{r}

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
